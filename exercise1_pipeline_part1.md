# Exercise 1 - Pipeline - Part 1

> [!NOTE]
> These exercises covers lectures 05-06, and prerequisite knowledge of dagster and docker in previous courses.

## 1. Replacing an automation component in dagster pipeline
In lecture 05_Pipeline_DuckDB, we use dagster sensor for starting the dbt job. Now,
- replace the sensor with a schedule and run the dagster server
- explain what is the difference between using a sensor and a schedule for starting the dbt job. 
- which one is a better choice for this job? 
- can we replace the schedule for the dlt job with a sensor?

## 2. Containerization
This is a theory question for you to deepen your understanding of containerization. Explain intuitively:
- the difference between:
  - running python scripts locally with virtual environment activated
  - running containerized python scripts locally 
- the difference between virtual environment and uv virtual environment
- the difference between containerization and Docker
