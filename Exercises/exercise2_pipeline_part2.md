# Exercise 2 - Pipeline - Part 2

> [!NOTE]
> These exercises covers lectures 07-09, and prerequisite knowledge of dagster and docker in previous courses.

## 1. Azure Container Instance vs Azure Web App
In lecture 09_Azure_Web_App, we deploy our dashboard container to Azure Web App.
- Can you deploy the dashboard container to Azure Container Instance instead?
- If yes to the above question, try to do it.
- Also, can you explain what are the differences when deploying the dashboard container to these two separate Azure computing resources?

## 2. Comparison with other cloud providers
### Computing services
In lecture 07-09, we have used Azure Container Registry, Azure Container Instance and Azure Web App. Can you find out what are the equivalent products you can purchase from AWS (Amazon Web Services) and GCP (Google Cloud Platform)? What are the names of these products?

### Data stores
Similarly, find if there are equivalent products in another two cloud platform providers for Azure File Share.
